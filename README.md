# SpriteChangeCamAngle
This is a simple script, that change the sprite, by object and camera angle, like FF tactics, and other tactics, rpgs, and simple 2d characters with 3d level. Im using with my game called "Monsters Mall" but is a cool thing to release as free asset for anyone that want to do a game like this, some kind of isometric 3d with 2d characters, I LOVE this kind of graphics, when mix 2d characters with 3d level, like guardian heroes, ff tactics etc.

-In this script is ready to use with 4 way bodies, just as I use in my game, but can be fast changed to be used with 6 angle bodies.

-In my project I change the gameobject when consider an different angle, but a good way to do it too is changing the layer of animation on character.

-Amazing for RPG, Tactic Games, even Board Games.

-The focus of this project is just the sprite change, so the camera is very simple, with A and D the user can rotate it, but is up to you to make different cameras to make a game.
